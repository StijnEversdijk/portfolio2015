    <h4>Designing the user interface</h4>

    <p>
      The minor programme was created to let us work on a project for a half schoolyear and design our own ‘ideal’ studio environment. The period will be separated in two phases; a Research &amp; Concept phase and a Creation phase. Both will take 8 weeks of intensive work.
    </p>

    <p>
      The project was divided in two phases; a Research &amp; Concept phase and a Creation Phase. We were working in a group of four, where everyone would be responsible for one of the four roles; Visual Design, Prototyping, Interaction Design and Concept/Strategy/Planning. Mine would be Prototyping.
    </p>


    <h4>
      From briefing to defrief
    </h4>

    <p>
      The programme started of with a brief from our client, IceMobile; a digital agency from Amsterdam, specialised in the retail branche. With help of a kick off workshop, we tried to find the expectations our client has of us.
    </p>


    <h4>
      Exploratory research with quantative&nbsp;data
    </h4>

    <p>
      During our project, we would focus on food, and combining this with the fun-factor. We had no clue where to start or what the context looked like. The assignment was very broad, so we could focus on any subject related to food; obesity, lack of time to cook, recipes, healthy eating, you name it.
    </p>

    <p>
      To get a grasp on what we were dealing with, we started out with mapping our assumptions. All we needed for this were some post-its and a whiteboard. Our goal was to bust as many of those assumptions with our following research. After this, we conducted a survey. This provided us with some basic insights and possible angles for our project.

    <p>
      We created a stakeholder map, and based on the information we had so far, we were ready to get in touch with potential target audiences.
    </p>

    <h4>Going in depth</h4>
    <p>
      In six days, we gathered as much information as we could. Our main research techniques was the creation of customer journeys with the respondents. This would give us a good view of both the ‘before’, ‘during’ and ‘after’ situations.
    </p>

    <p>
      We wrote all of our raw data and insights onto post-its, and started grouping them to see if there are any similarities or opposing statements in the data, which we could use as values for our archetype axis. We also created four target groups which we could further explore by putting them somewhere on the axis of the archetype systems.

    <p>
      Last, but not least, we used acquired information about the target groups from the archetype system to create a very complete customer journey map which displayed not only the actions, but also the feelings , thoughts, and corresponding platforms at every moment of the customer journey.
    </p>

    <p>
      We presented our insights to the client. Based on the discussion with our client, we picked a target audience for our project.

    <h4>Concept Phase</h4>

    <p>
      We started off quick, and immediately started creating concepts. We noticed this was not the way we should approach this phase. We found out that we still didn’t know enough about our final target audience, so we gave ourselves one extra week to do research.
    </p>

    <p>
      After having gathered a lot of useful insights, we started again. We used different creative methods to facilitate the brainstorm sessions. We brainstormed on different keywords and used associative techniques.
    </p>

    <p>
      We had a longlist of around 20 concepts. We narrowed this down to three. To validate our concepts, we quickly made a storyboard. We would then go to our target audience and discuss our newborn concepts.
    </p>
    <img src="img/iuxd/storyboarding.jpg" />
    <p>
      We wanted to give our concepts a bit more body, so we started thinking of scenarios in which you would use our concept, the problems the concept should tackle and features the concept should have.
    </p>

    <p>
      To get our concepts to a next fidelity, we created motion dummies. We noticed that words are just words. A visual will make everything much clearer, when you have discuss your idea. To get a grasp on our concepts, we even acted out our concept with a role-play, just to gain knowledge.
    </p>

    <p>
      We presented to our client, and we picked one concept to work on in the creation phase. When we came back to our desks, we noticed that this concept wasn’t the one. Somehow, we altered an old concept we killed early on in the proces, scheduled a Skype-call with the client and we realised that this was the concept we should go for.
    </p>

    <h4>Creation phase</h4>

    <p>
      Next up was the creation phase, for a period of eight weeks. We all had some experience working on a project, but we never did a project in an agile way, as it tells you in the books. We took a go through the book ‘Get Agile’, create user stories, a product statement, play planning poker and create sprint goals. The create-phase contained three sprints; one of three weeks and two sprints of two weeks.

      From the start, we all had a different responsibility within the team. Mine was prototyping. Quickly we noticed that we were working on our own island, and not really communicating. We decided to change the roles. We split up in two; one team being responsible for everything concerning interaction and one team for everything visual.

    <p>
      I would work together with one teammate on the interaction team. We drastically changed our workflow, to get the most out of the time we had together. Instead of making enormous amounts of wireframes, we started with a small sketch of a page. We created the sketch while discussing it with each other. Then, we would rapidly work out the wireframe, or set of wireframes, in Illustrator. We would run to the printer, print the wireframes you just created in 10 - 15 minutes. You give every team member a big marker and start discussing everything you notice, within a maximum amount of time. This would lead to new sketches and wireframes and we would iterate multiple times, before coming to a final solution.

    <p>
      Next to the interaction design, we were also responsible for the prototypes. Within a project you have a lot of different aspects to prototype. For the overall flow, we created an easy InVision prototype. Small interactions were prototyped with Framer, which would be much more time-expensive, but the focus on animation and really being able to play around with your design made it really valuable.

      Prototyping within this project varied from creating storyboards, making motion dummies to work out prototypes with code.

      During a sprint you keep learning. Especially the moment when we realised that we were trying to over-deliver within one sprint. We decided to cut out some features, or that they wouldn’t be a part of out MVP. I spent two days working with an Arduino, just to realise that this wasn’t the way to go. The benefit of our flexible team was that it was easy to find a solution for this.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the moment, we are still working on this project. We are trying to improve parent-child interaction through cooking. Cooking should be fun, but can also be educational. Both parent and child can benefit from this. For us, this was a real challenge, because the target group couldn’t be further away. This also made it exciting and made our research even more valuable.
