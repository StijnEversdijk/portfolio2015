    <h3>The challenge</h3>
    <p>
        Kuvva is known as the app for iOS and Mac that will bring you a set of beautifully illustrated wallpapers to your homescreen on a weekly basis. The idea was to create a platform for illustration to purely show and share the best work on your own screen. The Kuvva-team was doing this since 2012. In december 2013 Kuvva was ready for a pivot.

          With the enormous database of illustrations and users and the authority they gained by curating and highlighting the best illustrations, Kuvva was ready for a pivot. We would start selling licenses, so the illustrations could be used in campaigns, magazines and advertisements on a legal basis. We would cut out the middle man and empower both the client as the illustrator. All that, without losing interest from our daily users, who were only looking for beautiful illustrations.

          This meant completely rethinking Kuvva; a new identity, a redesign of our website, a new strategy et cetera.

      <h3>Extending the brand</h3>
      <p>
        With the Kuvva-project we worked in a team varying, over time, from 4 to 8 people. My main focus within the project would be the surrounding ‘communications’.
      </p>

      <p>
        To stay relevant within the community, we wanted to share good content with our audience. This meant we needed a blog, but also a Tumblr. And how do we communicate concerning our apps, which would still have the same functionality? My task was to discuss this, design the interfaces and implement it.

      <p>
        Besides this all, the main product was also in development. How do you design in a same style, if this style is still being designed? That Kuvva wasn’t a finished product, while I was working on it, made it even more fun. This way my designs would influence the endproduct. Substantial parts, such as typography, draw inspiration from the blog and vice versa.
      </p>
      <p>
        In July we launched the new marketplace and it’s under continuous development. I worked on a freelance basis for Kuvva and have stopped working on this project since October 2014.
