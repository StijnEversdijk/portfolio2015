# Designing with data

*Disclaimer: I write these posts to funnel my thoughts. Since I just started working at my first job after graduating from my BA in Communication and Multimedia Design I write this down to purely structure my thoughts and reflect on the work that I do and in what way I do that. It doesn’t have the goal to be holistic or complete, it is a continuous work in progress. I will not write separate posts, but work on topics and update these from time to time. I hope to end up with a nice body of work that will reflect my growth as a designer.*
