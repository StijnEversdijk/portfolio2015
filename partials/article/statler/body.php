    <h3>Statler # Sons</h3>
    <p>
      Since the moment we got involved with anything concerning design, my good friend Daan and I wanted to create. We started out working together, making album covers for bands, websites, photoshoots. You name it. In the end, we figured out that what we enjoyed the most, were our own <em>concepts</em>. Always in our spare time, due to study or work.

      But since early 2014 we started investing more time and devotion to our little brain child and start building an actual business. Our most recent project is <em>S#S Dinners</em>.

    <h3>Some projects</h3>

    <p>
      Every concept we developed was born from an desire of our own. We started running, so we created a running podcast. We went on a trip to Berlin, so we made our own alternative Tourist guide. We like coffee, so we make a coffee guide. We enjoy cooking, so we start giving dinners for friends and strangers.
