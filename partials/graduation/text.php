    Since the moment Nike started with their Nike+ platform, I wanted to be a part of it. I bought shoes, sensors and wristbands, just so I could check my running activities and be a part of the Nike community. Even when I couldn’t use Nike’s shoes anymore, I didn’t want to switch to a different platform.

    For me, this was a great example of integrating technology within my daily life. It would give me something; the brand and the metrics. And I would give Nike something in return, my loyalty and money. Even tough it was only a pimped up pedometer.

    A lot of inspiring concepts and products launch, but how many succeed? I want to look at possibilities to add value for the user, but also create loyalty towards a brand. All this with thanks to modern day technology.

    I hope you get excited by this idea, but if you have something else of what you think that would be interesting for me and my internship, I’m happy to <a href="mailto:mail@stijneversdijk.nl">talk about that</a> too!
