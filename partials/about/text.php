  <h2>
    My name is Stijn, <br /> I design and build digital stuff.
  </h2>

  <p>
    For the last year and half I’ve been working at <a href="http://presentplus.com">Present Plus</a>, an innovation studio from Amsterdam. I started out as a design intern and stayed on freelance, for two days a week, next to my study.
  </p>

  <p>
    At <em>Present Plus</em>, I was mainly focussing on <a href="kuvva.php">Kuvva</a>, where I would do <em>interface design</em> and <em>front-end development</em>. In my spare time I was creating crazy stuff with <a href="statler.php">Statler # Sons</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now, I’m looking for an adventure. I want to find a graduation internship, out of the Netherlands. Something new, something exciting. Getting out of my comfort zone. I hope you can <a href="mailto:mail@stijneversdijk.nl">help me</a> with this.
