    <h3>The challenge</h3>
    <p>Amongst Friends is a monthly sneak peak, organised by Hein and Nalden. Two friends who wanted show their friends some good films. Starting out with only a couple of good friends, the events grew and grew and started to sell out, month after month.</p>
    <p>Nalden and Hein saw time fit to evolve their concept, grow and get online presence.  They asked me to help them out on the digital side of things.</p>

    <h3>Responsive reading</h3>
    <p>The Amongst Friends website needed an optimal reading experience on any device you want to use. Beautiful images and great writing are in balance and the design tries to utilize the best of both worlds.</p>

    <h3>The works</h3>
    <p>Hein and Nalden wanted a place to air their opinions, ask other editors to write stories and promote their screenings. The team I worked with consisted out of three; one front-end developer, an identity designer and me. I would take care of the interface design.</p>
    <p>Since the interface design happened quit early on in the proces, I quickly evolved into a jack of all trades. I was helping with the content, gave feedback on the new logo and helped coding the front-end.</p>
